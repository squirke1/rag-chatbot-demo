Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing.

How RAG Works:

1. Document Retrieval: When a user asks a question, the system first searches through a database of documents to find relevant information.

2. Context Integration: The retrieved documents are then combined with the user's query to provide context.

3. Response Generation: A large language model uses both the query and the retrieved context to generate an informed, accurate response.

Benefits of RAG:

- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in actual documents
- Allows language models to access up-to-date information
- Enables question-answering over private or domain-specific data
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning large models

Key Components:

Vector Embeddings: Text is converted into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.

Vector Database: Stores document embeddings for fast similarity search (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).

Language Model: Generates natural language responses based on retrieved context (e.g., GPT, Claude).

Applications:

RAG systems are used in customer support chatbots, documentation assistants, research tools, and any application requiring accurate question-answering over large document collections.
